# JsonToNeo

This Go script processes **JSON output from HTTPX (Project Discovery)** and imports the data into a **Neo4j database**. It extracts information about **hosts, IP addresses, technologies, and ASN data**, structuring them into a graph database for further analysis.

## üöÄ Features
- **Processes JSON line by line** to minimize memory usage.  
- **Automates data import into Neo4j** for visualization and analysis.  
- **Creates relationships** between Hosts, IPs, Technologies, and ASN data.  
- **Supports command-line arguments** for flexible file input.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### 1. Installation
Install directly using Go and remember that the password in the main.go file needs to be changed to the password of your Neo4j setup:  
```sh
go install github.com/pocahon/jsontoneo@latest
```
### 2. Configuration

The Neo4j credentials (such as URI, username, and password) are configured in main.go. This file will be created automatically in the following location upon first run:

You can modify the file to set your Neo4j URI, username, and password. The default content of the configuration file looks like this:
```sh
neo4j:
  uri: "neo4j://localhost:7687"
  user: "neo4j"
  password: "neo4jpass"
```
### 3. Usage

After installation, you can run the script by specifying the path to the JSON file you wish to process. The script will automatically import the data into your Neo4j database, creating nodes and relationships based on the extracted information.
```sh
jsontoneo -f /path/to/your/httpx-output.json
